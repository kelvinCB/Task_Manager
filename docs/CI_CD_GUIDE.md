# CI/CD Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Task Manager project.

## CI/CD Strategy

### Tools
- **GitHub Actions**: Primary CI/CD platform
- **Vercel**: Frontend deployment automation
- **Railway/Heroku**: Backend deployment automation

### Branch Strategy
- **main**: Production deployments
- **develop**: Staging deployments
- **feature/***: PR validation only

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Code Quality
- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- TypeScript compilation check

### 2. Testing
- Unit tests with Vitest
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- E2E tests with Playwright (implemented)
  - Headed mode for development
  - Headless mode for CI/CD
  - Screenshot capture on failures
  - Sequential execution for stability

### 3. Build
- Frontend build with Vite
- Backend build (when implemented)
- Docker image creation (future)

### 4. Security
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secret scanning
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

### 5. Deployment
- Automatic deployment to staging on develop branch
- Automatic deployment to production on main branch
- Rollback capabilities

## Environment Configuration

### Development
- Local development with hot reload
- Local testing environment

### Staging
- Staging database and services
- Pre-production testing
- Integration testing

### Production
- Production database and services
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### Pull Request Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr.yml
# - Run tests
# - Run linting
# - Build check
# - Security scanning
```

### Deployment Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
# - Test suite
# - Build application
# - Deploy to environment
# - Post-deployment tests
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Health Checks
- API endpoint health checks
- Database connectivity checks
- External service status

### Notifications
- Slack/Discord notifications for deployments
- Email alerts for failures
- Dashboard for pipeline status

## Rollback Procedures

### Frontend Rollback
1. Revert deployment in Vercel dashboard
2. Or deploy previous Git commit/tag

### Backend Rollback
1. Use platform-specific rollback (Heroku, Railway)
2. Database migration rollback if needed

## Security Considerations

### Secrets Management
- Store secrets in GitHub Secrets
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Never expose secrets in logs

### Access Control
- Limit who can trigger deployments
- Require PR reviews for main branch
- Branch protection rules

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- Build time trends
- Test execution time
- Deployment frequency
- Lead time for changes
- Mean time to recovery

### Tools
- GitHub Actions insights
- Vercel analytics
- Custom monitoring dashboards

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build Failures**
   - Check dependency versions
   - Verify environment variables
   - Review build logs

2. **Test Failures**
   - Run tests locally first
   - Check for test environment issues
   - Review test logs and screenshots

3. **Deployment Issues**
   - Verify environment configuration
   - Check service availability
   - Review deployment logs

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- [ ] Multi-environment testing
- [ ] Automated performance testing
- [ ] Advanced security scanning
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- [ ] Canary deployments
- [ ] Feature flags integration

### Integration Opportunities
- [ ] Jira/Linear integration for automatic issue linking
- [ ] Slack integration for team notifications
- [ ] Datadog/New Relic for advanced monitoring

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch from develop
2. Write tests for new functionality
3. Ensure all checks pass locally
4. Create PR with proper description
5. Address review feedback
6. Merge after approval

### Deployment Best Practices
1. Deploy small, frequent changes
2. Monitor deployments closely
3. Have rollback plan ready
4. Test in staging first
5. Communicate changes to team

## Configuration Files

### Required Files
- `.github/workflows/pr.yml` - PR validation
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Deployment pipeline
- `.github/dependabot.yml` - Dependency updates
- `package.json` - Scripts for CI/CD
- `Dockerfile` - Container configuration (future)

### Environment Files
- `.env.example` - Template for environment variables
- `.env.staging` - Staging environment configuration
- `.env.production` - Production environment configuration

**Next Steps for Implementation:**
1. Set up GitHub Actions workflows
2. Configure environment-specific deployments
3. Implement monitoring and alerting
4. Document troubleshooting procedures
5. Set up automated testing in CI/CD
