#### ✅ Required Actions
- ✅ Always update documentation when adding features
- ✅ Always update tests when necessary
- ✅ Always follow conventions from `CONVENTIONS.md`
- ✅ Always read this PRD before starting work
- ✅ Always create `.env.example` when using `.env`
- ✅ Always update `.gitignore` when needed
- ✅ Always perform code review for optimization

#### 🔍 Development Workflow
1. **Read Documentation:** Start by reading this PRD and relevant docs
2. **Understand Context:** Review existing code and features
3. **Follow Conventions:** Use established patterns and naming
4. **Write Tests:** Add/update tests for new functionality
5. **Update Docs:** Keep documentation current
6. **Code Review:** Optimize for performance and maintainability

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/TM-XXX-description` - Feature branches
- `bugfix/TM-XXX-description` - Bug fix branches
