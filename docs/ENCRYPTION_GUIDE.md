# Encryption Guide

## Overview

This document outlines best practices for encryption and data security within the Task Manager application.

## Encryption Techniques

### TLS Encryption
- Utilize HTTPS for all client-server communications to ensure data-in-transit protection.
- Ensure certificates are up-to-date and configured properly.

### Password Security
- Use `bcrypt` for hashing passwords before storing them in the database.
- Recommended bcrypt work factor: 12 for balancing security and performance.

### API Key and Secret Management
- Store sensitive information such as API keys and secrets in environment variables (`.env` files) and avoid hardcoding them into your source code.
- Use secret management services like AWS Secrets Manager for production environments.

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data in Transit
- Always use TLS to encrypt data moving between the client and server.
- Verify certificates to prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.

### Sensitive Data at Rest
- Regularly audit and update access permissions for databases and backups.
- Encrypt database backups where possible.

## Security Policies

### Access Control
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access based on user roles.
- Use least privilege for database access.

### Rate Limiting
- Enforce rate limits on API endpoints to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks.

### Regular Updates and Patch Management
- Keep all dependencies and server software updated.
- Monitor for security patches and apply them promptly.

## Incident Response

### Security Audits
- Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.
- Engage third-party security firms for penetration testing.

### Breach Protocol
- Establish a clear incident response plan including detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and follow-up.
- Maintain records of all breaches for compliance and post-mortem analysis.

## Additional Recommendations

### Logging and Monitoring
- Enable logging of access and error events.
- Monitor logs for suspicious activities.

### Legal Compliance
- Ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

### Team Training
- Conduct regular training sessions for the team on security best practices.
