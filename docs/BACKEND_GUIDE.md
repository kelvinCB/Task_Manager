# Backend Development Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the setup, architecture, and standards for backend development in the Task Manager project.

## Setup and Installation

- Install Node.js and necessary dependencies.
- Setup environment variables from `.env.example`.

## Architecture

- **Node.js** for server-side logic.
- **Express/Fastify** as the backend framework.
- **Supabase** for database and authentication.

## Key Components

- **API Endpoints:** Describe RESTful endpoints for task and user management.
- **Middleware:** Setup middleware for authentication and error handling.
- **Services:** Define services for business logic, like task management.

## Standards

- Follow consistent coding styles and linting rules.
- Ensure secure handling of all user inputs.

## Integration

- Integrate with frontend via RESTful APIs.
- Authenticity handling through JWT tokens.

## Testing

- Use Jest or similar for backend unit tests.
- Mock external services like databases for isolated testing.

## Placeholder Sections

- [ ] API Rate Limiting
- [ ] Service Layer Documentation
