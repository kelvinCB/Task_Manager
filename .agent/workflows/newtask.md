New Task,

To get proper context about the project, please read the following files:
@PRD_GUIDE.md, @BACKEND_GUIDE.md, @FRONTEND_GUIDE.md, @TESTING_GUIDE.md, and @CONVENTIONS.md.

If applicable, please create new unit tests for this change, either on the frontend or the backend. Additionally, if required, create new E2E tests and update @e2e/manual-test-cases-browserstack if any new E2E tests are added.

Also, create a Git branch following the existing branch naming conventions. Create a new branch for this task using the same format and switch to it. The branch should follow the pattern TM-?? (log in to GitHub using the MCP, go to the TaskManager project, find the latest pull request number, and increment it by 1).

Once you finish the implementation:
Make sure to run the frontend unit tests, backend unit tests, and E2E tests to verify that nothing was broken and to confirm whether any existing tests need to be updated.

In the walkthrough you provide, include the commit message, but do not create the commit yourself. I will create the commit based on the message you provide.

Task to be implemented:
(The user will describe the task details below.)
