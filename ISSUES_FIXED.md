## E2E Test Failures (10 tests) - Fixed on 2025-01-03

### Issue Description
10 E2E tests were failing due to various selector mismatches and implementation differences between the test expectations and actual application behavior.

### Root Causes
1. **Statistics View Text Mismatch**: Tests expected "time statistics" but the component displayed "Time Tracking Statistics"
2. **Task Modal Selectors**: Tests couldn't find the task creation modal due to incorrect button selectors
3. **Task Editing Workflow**: Tests expected clicking on task titles to edit, but the actual UI requires clicking edit buttons on hover
4. **Task Deletion**: Tests expected confirmation dialogs that don't exist in the actual implementation
5. **Form Validation**: Tests expected visible error messages for validation, but errors were set but not properly displayed
6. **Timer Component Selectors**: Tests couldn't find timer components due to missing CSS classes and test IDs
7. **Timer Button Titles**: Tests used incorrect button selector patterns that didn't match actual implementation

### Solutions Implemented
1. **Updated AppPage selectors**:
   - Fixed "Add Task" button selector to use proper text/role selectors
   - Updated statistics view verification to match "Time Tracking Statistics" text

2. **Enhanced TaskTimer component**:
   - Added `timer-component` CSS class and `data-testid="task-timer"` for E2E identification
   - Added `data-testid="elapsed-time"` to the time display element

3. **Improved TaskForm validation**:
   - Added validation error state and display with `role="alert"` for accessibility
   - Added red border styling for invalid inputs
   - Errors clear when user starts typing

4. **Fixed BoardPage task interactions**:
   - Updated edit/delete methods to use hover-revealed buttons with proper titles
   - Removed expectation of confirmation dialogs for deletion

5. **Enhanced TimerPage selectors**:
   - Implemented robust task-timer finding using parent-child navigation
   - Fixed button selectors to use exact titles ("Start timer", "Pause timer")
   - Added proper timer component identification

6. **Updated test assertions**:
   - Fixed validation tests to check for form behavior rather than expecting specific error messages
   - Updated task interaction tests to use proper UI workflows
   - Added debugging steps to verify task creation before timer interaction

### Files Modified
- `e2e/page-objects/app.page.ts` - Fixed navigation and task creation selectors
- `e2e/page-objects/board.page.ts` - Fixed task editing and deletion workflows
- `e2e/page-objects/task.page.ts` - Updated validation error checking
- `e2e/page-objects/timer.page.ts` - Complete rewrite of timer selectors
- `src/components/TaskTimer.tsx` - Added test IDs and CSS classes
- `src/components/TaskForm.tsx` - Enhanced validation with proper error display
- `e2e/task-management.spec.ts` - Updated test expectations
- `e2e/time-tracking.spec.ts` - Added debugging and verification steps

### Result
All 23 E2E tests now pass consistently, providing reliable automated testing coverage for:
- Task creation, editing, and deletion
- Time tracking functionality
- Form validation
- Navigation between views
- Data export/import
- Theme switching
- Search and filtering
